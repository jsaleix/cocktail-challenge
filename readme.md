# ZAMA CHALLENGE

> Here is your challenge, if you accept it!
> 
> We're launching an exciting new service: a custom cocktail recipe generator. 
> This application is designed for cocktail enthusiasts, allowing them to input their available ingredients and discover new cocktail recipes they can prepare.
> Our service offers a nice-looking frontend designed to inspire users to explore new cocktails. It allows users to view, sort, filter and search through all available cocktails by description.
> They can also save their favorite cocktails locally and share them with their friends!
> All the cocktails are available at [https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
> but you can use a different API if you prefer.
